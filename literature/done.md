stripe::
 Running npm i stripe will install the Stripe Node.js SDK, which you can use to interact with Stripeâ€™s API. If you're building a Next.js application, you might also want to install @stripe/stripe-js for handling Stripe on the client-side.
So, your installation command could be:
npm install stripe @stripe/stripe-js


This ensures you have both the server-side and client-side libraries set up properly.
