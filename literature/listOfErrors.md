\\hydration error::

1:: Hydration errors occur when there's a mismatch between the HTML generated on the server and what React expects to render on the client during the reconciliation process. When React hydrates the server-rendered content, it expects the client-side render to produce the exact same HTML structure.

Common Causes
Hydration errors can occur from:

Incorrect nesting of HTML tags
<p> nested in another <p> tag
<div> nested in a <p> tag
<ul> or <ol> nested in a <p> tag
Interactive Content cannot be nested (<a> nested in a <a> tag, <button> nested in a <button> tag, etc.)
Using checks like typeof window !== 'undefined' in your rendering logic
Using browser-only APIs like window or localStorage in your rendering logic
Using time-dependent APIs such as the Date() constructor in your rendering logic
Browser extensions modifying the HTML
Incorrectly configured CSS-in-JS libraries
Ensure your code is following our official examples
Incorrectly configured Edge/CDN that attempts to modify the html response, such as Cloudflare Auto Minify
