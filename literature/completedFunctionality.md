what functionality we have completed:


1:: we can create a user with email and password -  errors:  inputs do not clear

2:: sign in later with user and password -          errors: none 

3:: sign out, works as intended                     errors: input does not clear 

4:: sign in with google works as intended           errors: none

5:: uploading product, creating product, good, price is saved, file array is updated, even getting file array on auto update   errors: the image input says "choose files number files" in one line, and inputs do not clear, also check if images carry metadata with original product id attached to the file metadata

6:: we can add products to a cart by clicking on the product, which routes us to our folder structure api/products/[id]
---there we have "add to cart" and "go to cart", both working as intended




7:: generating QR code, it works, we create a great qr code , you just add your string value and the qr code generator creates a functional qr code that we can scan with qr devices
